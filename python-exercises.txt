== Python Exercises ==

1. Files and lists

Write a Python script that reads the contents of the passwd file (/etc/passwd) and
prints the shell used by every username. The output should be something like this:
root -> /bin/bash
daemon -> /bin/sh
bin -> /bin/sh
sys -> /bin/sh
sync -> /bin/sync
games -> /bin/sh
man -> /bin/sh
lp -> /bin/sh
mail -> /bin/sh
news -> /bin/sh
uucp -> /bin/sh
proxy -> /bin/sh
www-data -> /bin/sh

2. Files and dictionaries

Modify the script of the previous exercise to only show the shell used by a given
user. The shell used by every username should be stored in a dictionary, and the user-
name of which you want to get the shell will be provided as a command line argument.
You should handle possible errors like invalid user names or even if no user name is
provided.

3. Calculator

Write a script to work like a calculator, implementing basic operations (+, -, *,/),
for two operators. The script will receive the operators and the operation from the
command line, see the examples below:

$ ./calculator.py 30 + 25
$ ./calculator.py 30 - 25
$ ./calculator.py 30 \* 25
$ ./calculator.py 30 / 25

Note that ’*’ must be escaped, since it’s a special character for the shell. Every
possible error should be handled showing appropriate error messages.
